This Haskell software package implements the Gröbner basis algorithm
as described in Vladimir Dotsenko, Anton Khoroshkin: "Gröbner bases
for operads" (arXiv:0812.4096).

In order to use it, make sure you install ghc, cabal and haddock (see
http://haskell.org for more details). These are available directly in
most Linux and BSD distributions, and there are installers for MacOSX
and Windows available on http://haskell.org.

Once ghc is installed, install cabal-install, and then use that to
install everything else needed. This tool will make the installation
of everything else painless.

To install the package, download the most recent tar ball
Operads-n.n.tar.gz, and then perform the following steps:

1) copy the tarball into an appropriate temporary directory
2) in this temporary directory, execute 
     tar -xzvf Operads-n.n.tar.gz
3) enter the directory Operads-0.2
4) run the following commands
     ghc --make Setup.hs
     ./Setup configure
     ./Setup build
     ./Setup install
5) look through the example files
     example.hs
     altDual.hs
     preLieBad.hs
   to get a feeling for the syntax for interaction, and read the
   documentation. 

   You can get a computation system by running
     ghci
   and then inside ghci running
     :m + Math.Operad

   You can also write your own scripts for computation, and run them
   as Haskell programs. This will allow more latitude in using
   parallel processing and advanced computation techniques, but
   exceeds the scope of this README.

Pitfalls: 
  * Make sure you run the program from somewhere else than the
    temporary building directory, as this would load the wrong files.
